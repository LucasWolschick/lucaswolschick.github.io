        <p>
          I am a computer science student and researcher in title, and a
          programmer, problem solver and learner at heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been programming at some capacity since 2012, when I started
          making my own games with Lua and Roblox. Ever since then, I have been
          exploring different areas in computer science and learning new
          technologies and languages, largely by myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years I have been aiming to refine my skills and to
          formalize my education at university. I study at the State University
          of Maringá (UEM), in Brazil.

        <h1>Skills</h1>
        <p>
          I have experience with the following technologies and programming
          languages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rust</li>
          <li>Lua</li>
          <li>C</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>JS</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>FastAPI</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
          <li>Roblox</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My areas of interest include programming language design and
          implementation, game development, game design, systems programming,
          tooling, information security, machine learning, artificial
          intelligence, mathematics and computer graphics, among others. I also
          enjoy teaching and learning new topics.

                I wrote together with my colleagues a program that emulates the
                Scoreboard algorithm, which is a dynamic instruction scheduling
                algorithm in computer architecture, as described in the book
                'Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach' by David A.
                Patterson and John L. Hennessy. The program contains an
                assembler for a MIPS-like assembly language and a CPU simulator
                which implements the algorithm in detail. The program is written
                in C and was developed for the computer architecture course at
                UEM.

                participated in candidate selection processes for the group and
                conducted academic research, among other activities.

        <p>
          My research work has been mainly in the area of machine learning and
          artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, I am working on a research project related to acoustic
          scene classification, which is a task in the area of audio signal
          processing that aims to classify audio recordings of environments into
          different categories. This project is being developed under the
          orientation of prof. Dr. Yandre Costa, at UEM.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past, I have worked on a research project related to
          search-based software engineering, which aims to apply machine
          learning techniques to solve hard software engineering problems. I
          have co-written a paper in this area which was published in the 17th
          Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse,
          and which won a Distinguished Paper Award.
