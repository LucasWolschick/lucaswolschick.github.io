          I am a computer scientist, software engineer and researcher in title
          and a programmer, problem solver and learner at heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2012, when I first started making my own games with Lua and
          Roblox, I have been exploring different areas in computer science and
          learning new technologies, languages and paradigms as I go. Nowadays I
          have been interested in learning about people problems, management and
          strategic thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from UEM and currently work as a
          full-stack web developer.

                At DB1 Global Software, I worked on multiple client projects
                using C#, ASP.NET, Angular, PostgreSQL, AWS, and other
                technologies. In one project, I studied and optimized EF Core
                queries, reducing execution times by up to 50%. My performance
                and peer-recognized technical and soft skills led to a rapid
                promotion from trainee to junior in just five months. I also
                contributed to back-end integrations for ERP and logistics
                systems using C# and ASP.NET, gaining strategic system-level
                experience, and supported team cohesion through informal
                initiatives that improved collaboration and morale.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>
          My research has focused on machine learning, programming languages,
          and compiler technologies. At UEM, I worked on acoustic scene
          classification, proposing a novel method for combining classifiers in
          hierarchical contexts. I also co-authored a paper on applying machine
          learning to search-based software engineering, published at the 17th
          Brazilian Symposium on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse,
          which received a Distinguished Paper Award. For my final course
          project, I implemented a WebAssembly backend for the Gleam compiler in
          Rust with wasm-tools, supporting advanced features such as pattern
          matching.
